# Description

I installed at my home the heat pump. This kind of device consumes some electrical energy to transfer heat to my home. I am really curious how much electrical energy needs this device daily. So I decided to monitor main wattmeter of my home. I bought raspberry pi zero W, picamera version 1.3. I am capturing frames of wattmeter digit display. Every image is digitally preprocessed. It is recognised position of display in the frame and seven digits as you can see on images bellow.
The really nice article about digits recognition with opencv and python is [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/13/recognizing-digits-with-opencv-and-python/). The article inspired me a lot and I only modified the described code to fit to my project.
